HOW TO GENERATE YOUR APK FILE

Because you are on Windows, you cannot run 'buildozer' natively.
Use this free Google Colab script to compile the APK for you.

1. Open a new notebook at: https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Paste the following code into the first cell and run it (Shift+Enter).
3. It will ask you to upload files. Upload the 'main.py' and 'buildozer.spec' files found in the 'android_build' folder I created.
4. Wait about 10-15 minutes for the compilation.
5. The cell will trigger a download of your 'ColabMobile-0.1-debug.apk'.
